# Frontend Mentor - Crowdfunding Product Page

![My solution for this challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design above as possible.

This is my solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I've decided to complete this mini-project using HTML, SCSS, & JS.
